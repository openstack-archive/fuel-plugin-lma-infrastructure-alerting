Plugin configuration
--------------------

**To configure the StackLight Infrastructure Alerting plugin:**

#. Create a new environment as described in `Create a new OpenStack environment
   <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/fuel-docs/userdocs/fuel-user-guide/create-environment/start-create-env.html>`__.

#. In the Fuel web UI, click the :guilabel:`Settings` tab and select the
   :guilabel:`Other` category.

#. Scroll down through the settings until you find
   :guilabel:`The StackLight Infrastructure Alerting Plugin` section.

#. Select :guilabel:`The StackLight Infrastructure Alerting Plugin` and fill
   in the required fields as indicated below.

      :width: 400pt

   a. If required, override the Nagios web interface self-generated password.
   #. Select the types of notifications that you would like to be alerted for
      by email (:guilabel:`CRITICAL`, :guilabel:`WARNING`, :guilabel:`UNKNOWN`,
      :guilabel:`RECOVERY`).

   #. Specify the recipient email address for the alerts.
   #. Specify the sender email address for the alerts.
   #. Specify the SMTP server address and port.
   #. Specify the SMTP authentication method.
   #. Specify the SMTP username and password. This is not required if the
      authentication method is :guilabel:`None`.

#. Select :guilabel:`Enable TLS for Nagios` if you want to encrypt your Nagios
   web UI credentials (username, password). Then, fill in the required fields
   as indicated below.

   .. image:: ../images/tls_settings.png
      :width: 400pt

   a. Specify the DNS name of the Nagios web UI. This parameter is used
      to create a link from within the Fuel dashboard to the Nagios web UI.
   #. Specify the location of the PEM file, which contains the certificate
      and the private key of the server that will be used in TLS handchecks
      with the client.

#. Select :guilabel:`Use LDAP for Nagios Authentication` if you want to
   authenticate through LDAP to the Nagios Web UI. Then, fill in the required
   fields as indicated below.

   .. image:: ../images/ldap_auth.png
      :width: 400pt

   a. Select the :guilabel:`LDAPS` if you want to enable LDAP authentication
      over SSL.
   #. Specify one or several LDAP server addresses separated by a space. These
      addresses must be accessible from the node where Nagios is installed.
      Addresses outside the *management network* are not routable by default
      (see the note below).
   #. Specify the LDAP server port number or leave it empty to use the defaults.
   #. Specify the :guilabel:`Bind DN` of a user who has search privileges on
      the LDAP server.
   #. Specify the password of the user identified by :guilabel:`Bind DN` above.
   #. Specify the :guilabel:`User search base DN` in the Directory Information
      Tree (DIT) from where to search for users.
   #. Specify a valid :guilabel:`User search filter` to search for users. The
      search should return a unique user entry.

   You can further restrict access to the Nagios web UI to those users who
   are members of a specific LDAP group. However, with the Nagios web UI there
   is no notion of privileged (admin) access.

   a. Select :guilabel:`Enable group-based authorization` to restrict the
      access to a group of users.
   #. Specify the LDAP attribute in the user entry to identify the group of
      users.
   #. Specify the DN of the LDAP group that has access to the Nagios web UI.

#. Configure your environment as described in `Configure your Environment
   <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/fuel-docs/userdocs/fuel-user-guide/configure-environment.html>`__.

   .. note:: By default, StackLight is configured to use the *management
      network*, of the so-called `Default Node Network Group
      <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/fuel-docs/userdocs/fuel-user-guide/configure-environment/network-settings.html>`_. While this default setup may be
      appropriate for small deployments or evaluation purposes, it is
      recommended that you not use this network for StackLight in production.
      Instead, create a network dedicated to StackLight. Using a dedicated
      network for StackLight should improve performance and reduce the
      monitoring footprint. It will also facilitate access to the Nagios web UI
      after deployment.

#. Click the :guilabel:`Nodes` tab and assign the
   :guilabel:`Infrastructure_Alerting` role to the node or multiple nodes
   where you want to install the plugin.

   The example below shows that the *Infrastructure_Alerting* role is assigned
   to three nodes alongside with the *Elasticsearch_Kibana* role and the
   *InfluxDB_Grafana* role. The three plugins of the LMA toolchain back-end
   servers are installed on the same node.

   .. image:: ../images/lma_infrastructure_alerting_role.png
      :width: 450pt

   .. note:: Nagios clustering for high availability requires assigning the
      *Infrastructure_Alerting* role to three different nodes. You can add or
      remove nodes with the *Infrastructure_Alerting* role after deployment.

#. If required, adjust the disk partitioning as described in
   `Configure disk partitioning
   <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/fuel-docs/userdocs/fuel-user-guide/configure-environment/customize-partitions.html>`_.

   By default, the StackLight Infrastructure Alerting plugin allocates:

     * 20% of the first available disk for the operating system by honoring a
       range of 15 GB minimum and 50 GB maximum
     * 10 GB for ``/var/log``
     * At least 20 GB for the Nagios data in ``/var/nagios``

   The deployment will fail if the above requirements are not met.

#. Deploy your environment as described in `Deploy an OpenStack environment
   <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/fuel-docs/userdocs/fuel-user-guide/deploy-environment.html>`__.
