Logging, Monitoring and Alerting (LMA) Infrastructure Alerting Plugin for Fuel
==============================================================================

Overview
--------

The `LMA Infrastructure Alerting` plugin is composed of several services
running on a node (base-os role). It provides the alerting functionality for
the OpenStack Infrastructure inside the `LMA toolchain` [1]_.

.. [1] The LMA toolchain is currently composed of these Fuel plugins:

        * [LMA collector Plugin](https://github.com/stackforge/fuel-plugin-lma-collector)
        * [InfluxDB-Grafana Plugin](https://github.com/stackforge/fuel-plugin-influxdb-grafana)
        * [Elasticsearch-Kibana Plugin](https://github.com/stackforge/fuel-plugin-elasticsearch-kibana)

Requirements
------------

| Requirement                               | Version/Comment  |
| ----------------------------------------- | -----------------|
| Mirantis OpenStack compatility            | 6.1 or higher    |
| LMA Collector Fuel plugin                 | 0.7 or higher    |
| InfluxDB-Grafana Fuel plugin (optional)   | 0.7 or higher    |

Recommendations
---------------

None.

Limitations
-----------

Adding and removing node to/from an environment won't reconfigure the Nagios
server.
This limitation is due to the missing ability of Fuel Plugin Framework to apply
plugin tasks (puppet apply) when these operations occur.

Installation Guide
==================

To install the LMA Infrastructure Alerting plugin, follow these steps:

1. Download the plugin from the [Fuel Plugins
   Catalog](https://software.mirantis.com/download-mirantis-openstack-fuel-plug-ins/).

2. Copy the plugin file to the Fuel Master node. Follow the [Quick start
   guide](https://software.mirantis.com/quick-start/) if you don't have a running
   Fuel Master node yet.

   ```
   scp lma_infrastructure_alerting-0.7-0.7.0-0.noarch.rpm root@<the Fuel Master node IP address>:
   ```

3. Install the plugin using the `fuel` command line:

   ```
   fuel plugins --install lma_infrastructure_alerting-0.7-0.7.0-0.noarch.rpm
   ```

4. Verify that the plugin is installed correctly:

   ```
   fuel plugins
   ```

Please refer to the [Fuel Plugins wiki](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Fuel/Plugins)
if you want to build the plugin by yourself, version 2.0.0 (or higher) of the Fuel
Plugin Builder is required.
