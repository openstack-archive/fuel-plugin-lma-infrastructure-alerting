# The plugin requires the allocation of 2 virtual IPs:
# One VIP is used for the Nagios UI and the other for the /status location
# exclusively used by LMA collectors to report statuses.
# This split will help to enable HTTPS for the Nagios UI and deploy it on
# another network while LMA collectors continue to use HTTP over the
# "monitoring" network.
